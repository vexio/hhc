# Welcome to Ultra-Hyper Hardcore


### **What is UHC?**

Before I begin, this idea and expansion is based off of the extremely popular Minecraft gamemode, *Ultra Hardcore*. Created by Guude and the Mindcrack group, the premise of the gamemode is that natural regeneration is disabled, and the only possible way to regenerate is to consume a Golden Apple or create a Potion of Regeneration/Instant Healing.


### **What is UHHC?**

*UHHC* is a planned extension and re-imagining of *UHC*. Currently, ideas are still in the works, but the core game play will remain the same as *UHC*. With UHHC, we are planning on creating an open-source core engine for the gamemode, so server owners can use or re-create the code to host their own games.


### **What's the status?**

Currently, I am developing an outline of UHHC as a whole via [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14HgrlUTtx3M64CHHajEPegmDLqa-SKuBEE7OecddUzE/edit?usp=sharing). Feel free to view and criticize my current thought process of this idea. If you feel something should be different, please contact me via [Twitter (@vexiovevo)](https://twitter.com/vexiovevo)
