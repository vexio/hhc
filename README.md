# Welcome to Ultra-Hyper Hardcore

**What is UHC?**

Before I begin, this idea and expansion is based off of the extremely popular Minecraft gamemode, *Ultra Hardcore*. Created by Guude and the Mindcrack group, the premise of the gamemode is that natural regeneration is disabled, and the only possible way to regenerate is to consume a Golden Apple or create a Potion of Regeneration/Instant Healing.


**What is UHHC?**

*UHHC* is a planned extension and re-imagining of *UHC*. Currently, ideas are still in the works, but the core game play will remain the same as *UHC*. With UHHC, we are planning on creating an open-source core engine for the gamemode, so server owners can use or re-create the code to host their own games.


**What's the status?**

You can watch the progression of the creation of UHHC via [Github](https://github.com/vexio/uhhc), where documentation and others can be found to create your own server to run UHHC.
